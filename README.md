# Data-Visualisation-Household-Consumption-Expenditure-Survey

The Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) is designed to collect
information on consumption of goods and services by the households. The survey
also collects some auxiliary information on household characteristics and
demographic particulars of the households. Information collected in HCES is useful
for understanding the consumption and expenditure pattern, standard of living and
well-being of the households. Besides, the data of HCES provides budget shares of
different commodity groups that is used for preparation of the weighting diagram for
compilation of official Consumer Price Indices (CPIs). The data collected in HCES is
also utilized for deriving various other macroeconomic indicators.

All data has been taken from the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation.
